# Chapter 1

## 1. Explain structured data.  Give examples.
Essentially, structured data is data that you can query, search, and address. It would most likely be found in a database. Since the data in databases is broken down into tables, columns, and rows, it can easily be looked at and analyzed. 

Examples of structured data include: Names, Phone Numbers, Addresses, ZIP Codes, and Social Security Numbers. These examples all have to do with personal information of customers. Other than this, structured data can also consist of financial transactions, inventory control information, and other business related items (airline/hotel reservations, etc.). All of these examples that have been provided would need to be held in some sort of database that can be searched, queried, and analyzed in order to be considered structured data.
## 2. Explain big data.
Big, in this sense, is actually a reference to amount more than size. It refers to a data set that is extremely large, so large in fact, that it cannot be processed and analyzed using normal, everyday tools. Big data comes from all over the place: social media, websites, photos/videos, email, and business transactions. Also, it is made up of both structured and unstructured data. Nowadays, every electronic device that is in the hands of the public is used to collect data and is adding to the juggernaut-like beast that is, big data. 

One example of a company that contributes large amounts of data, is Facebook. With over a billions accounts, Facebook has become a behemoth data aggregating machine. With millions and millions of users pouring their data into Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg, has been happily taking this data and selling it whoever is willing to pay. No wonder he's worth billions of dollars!
## 3. What is information-centric data.  How does it differ from server-centric storage architecture.
Data that is information-centric is managed via a storage network that does not rely on the servers. This data can be thought of as being stored on storage devices that are all part of the same network and readily available to talk to each other.
## 4. Explain virtualization.  Give examples.

## 5. Explain the 7 key characteristics of a data center.
